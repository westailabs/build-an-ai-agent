# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Claude Code

## Project Overview

**build-an-ai-agent** — Production AI agent course — no toy demos. Real architecture, real lessons, real deployment.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+


## Agent Instructions

- **Directives**: Follow the rules in [AI_DIRECTIVES.md](AI_DIRECTIVES.md).
- **Workflow**: Adhere to the process in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).
- **Context**: Refer to [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) for deeper architectural details.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Read and update [docs/AI_INSIGHTS.md](docs/AI_INSIGHTS.md).

## Git Workflow

### Permanent Branches (Remote)

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Releases only.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for the next release. All work merges here.

### Temporary Branches (Local Only)

**CRITICAL**: These branches exist **ONLY** on your local machine. You generally do **NOT** push them to origin unless working on a long-lived collaborative feature.

- **`feat/name`**: New features (models, services, UI).
- **`fix/description`**: Bug fixes.
- **`docs/description`**: Documentation updates.
- **`chore/description`**: Maintenance, config, refactoring.

### Rules

1. **Never commit directly to `main`** — all changes flow through `develop`.
2. **Branch off `develop`** for all new work.
3. **Temporary branches are LOCAL ONLY** — do NOT push them to origin. Merge locally into `develop`, then push `develop`.
4. **Merge with `--no-ff`** to preserve branch history.
5. **Delete feature branches** after merge — they are disposable.
6. **Run tests before merging** any branch.
7. **`git push origin` requires explicit user approval** — always ask first.

### Workflow

```bash
# Start new work
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Work, commit (conventional commits)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Merge back to develop (local only)
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feat/my-feature
git branch -d feat/my-feature

# Push develop (with approval)
git push origin develop
```

## Commit Conventions

- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:` prefixes
- **Imperative mood** in subject line: "add feature" not "added feature"
- **Keep subject under 72 characters** — use the body for detail

## Coding Standards

- **Type hints** on all function signatures
- **Google-style docstrings** on all public functions
- **Formatting**: `black` (line-length 88) + `flake8`
- **Testing**: `pytest` for all tests


## Discovery-Driven Development

- Check existing code in `src/` before proposing changes.
- Search for existing implementations before creating new utility functions.
- Check `pyproject.toml` before adding new dependencies.
